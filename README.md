# MATLAB SIGHTSEEING ACO

This repository is based on the ACO example from **EvanOman**. You can find the original code here: https://github.com/EvanOman/AntColonyOptimization-TSP 
The code was modified by me to find the best way through a list of sights within Germanys capital Berlin.
Below are some figures that show the progress made:
